                All around Sydney, there is parking space that is not being used
                24/7. Residential parking spaces sit empty during the day. Car
                parks often have empty spaces at night, or at weekends. Jetties
                and boat moorings are not always occupied. And outside of the
                cities, empty land could be generating income from parking for
                trucks, buses, shipping containers and even helicopters. Ampd
                lets you list your parking spaces for FREE. It will manage
                bookings, availability and even payments. And you'll get paid 2
                days after every booking. Tell your friends and family about
                Ampdâ€¦ It's a brilliant way to park in your city.
