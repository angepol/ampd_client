             All around Sydney, there is parking space that is not being used 24/7. Residential parking spaces sit empty during the day. Car parks often have empty spaces at night, or at weekends. Jetties and boat moorings are not always occupied. And outside of the cities, empty land could be generating income from parking for trucks, buses, shipping containers and even helicopters. Ampd lets you list your parking spaces for FREE. It will manage bookings, availability and even payments. And you'll get paid 2 days after every booking. Tell your friends and family about Ampdâ€¦ It's a brilliant way to park in your city.
